## Hi! I'm Daniel, an economist & engineer.

### Background

🏫 I am a graduate student at Cornell University, studying Applied Economics where I am a GTA for *MGMT 5090: Strategy*. 

🌱 Previously, I worked in fintech at a major stock exchange and then management consulting, focusing on M&A in the middle market healthcare and automotive sectors. 

🚂 Before working, I attended Purdue University, obtaining a bachelors in industrial engineering.

### Current Research & Reading

🚰 Currently, I am part of a team analyzing the global dynamics of water markets and their response to climate change. I will post a synopsis in the coming months.

📖 I am re-reading *Capital* by Piketty. Check back for some thoughts soon.
