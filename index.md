## Welcome to my page

Hi! I'm Daniel, an economist & engineer. 

### Current Reading

📖 I am re-reading *Capital* by Piketty. Check back for some thoughts soon.

### Background

🏫 I am a current masters student at Cornell University, studying Applied Economics where I am a GTA under Dr. Garrick Blalock, PhD for *MGMT 5090: Strategy*.
