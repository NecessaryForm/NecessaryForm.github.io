## Hi! I'm Daniel, an economist & engineer.

### Background

🏫 I am a current masters student at Cornell University, studying Applied Economics where I am a GTA for *MGMT 5090: Strategy* under Dr. Garrick Blalock, PhD.

🌱 Previously, I worked in fintech at a major stock exchange and then management consulting, focusing on M&A in the middle market healthcare and automotive sectors. 

🚂 Before working, I attended Purdue University, obtaining a bachelors in industrial engineering.

### Current Reading

📖 I am re-reading *Capital* by Piketty. Check back for some thoughts soon.
